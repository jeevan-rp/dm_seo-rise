# 🎨 3. Thumbnail Strategy
Use Canva templates with:

Bold fonts (Ex: Barlow Condensed, Anton)

Bright colors with high contrast

Emojis and real human faces

Tamil + English keywords

🖼 Example:

“📚 12th Physics Tricks in Tamil 🔥” — Large title + image of a teacher + yellow background.

# 📝 4. Title & Description Optimization
Best Practices:

Keep titles under 60 characters

Start with a searchable phrase (“How to…”, “What is…”)

Include Tamil terms for regional SEO (e.g., “Kalvi”, “Board Exam”)

Use timestamps, relevant hashtags (#12thPhysics #NEET2025), and a call-to-action
